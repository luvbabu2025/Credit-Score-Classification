Credit Score Classification for Paisabazaar
Project Summary: Credit Score Classification for Paisabazaar

Paisabazaar, a leading financial services platform, helps customers identify and apply for suitable banking and credit products. A critical aspect of this process is accurately assessing an individual’s creditworthiness, as it directly impacts loan approvals, risk management, and personalized financial recommendations.

This project focuses on developing a credit score classification model that predicts whether a customer falls into Good, Standard, or Poor credit categories based on their financial, demographic, and behavioral data. The dataset includes key attributes such as income details, credit card usage, loan information, repayment behavior, and credit history.

The project follows a structured data science workflow beginning with data cleaning and preprocessing, where missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data types are handled. This is followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends influencing credit scores. Feature engineering is then applied to enhance model performance by creating meaningful financial ratios and reducing redundancy.

Multiple machine learning classification algorithms are trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Special emphasis is placed on identifying high-risk customers to minimize potential loan defaults. The best-performing model is optimized through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

The outcome of this project enables Paisabazaar to make data-driven credit decisions, reduce financial risk, and deliver more personalized product recommendations to customers. Overall, the credit score classification system enhances operational efficiency and strengthens trust between Paisabazaar, its customers, and partner financial institutions.
